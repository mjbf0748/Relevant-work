TestRequest is an android studio app developed during my software engineering internship with MTX B2B the summer of 2017.

TEST.py is a basic python script I developed to run a three omni-wheeled robot using pulse-width modulation. The structure is setup for testing.

Temperature converter is a arduino script I developed to convert thermistor values from the volt readings to Celsius using lilypad thermistors.

Controller1.py is a script I developed to control a scribbler robot by prioritizing behaviors in order to have the robot find an orange cone and push it.
